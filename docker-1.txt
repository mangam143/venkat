                                                                 #DOCKER#
#TO CREATE CONTAINER FROM IMAGE

1)after connecting to ec2, the first thing we have to do that we have to install docker after logging into root user..
command for installation of docker yum install docker -y

2)after installation of docker, we have to restart the system for downloading the search engine
note:>before not restarting the system, if try to pull image from dockerhub, it doesnt exist, y becz we only have client engine(docker client)
     >docker client----------docker deamon-----------docker hub
     >before not restarting the system,check docker version,we only have client server not existed docker deamon yet
     >docker version command

note2:if we want to create a container, first, we should have an image(without image we cannt create a container)
     :if there is no image existed in local client,we can download or pull an image from docker hub
 
3)command for pulling an image from docker hub: docker pull some image name

4)now, we have an image(pulled some image from dockerhyb)

5)command for creation of acontainer : docker run -it --name <containername> <image name>
                                     : docker run -it --name <containername> <image name> /bin/bash
 (/bin/bash= we can interact with shell)                                       

6)now container has been created

7)command for checking an image list : docker images ls

8)command for checking stopped containers list : docker ps -a

note;
difference b/w docker ps and docker ps -a 
 1)docker ps means it shows the ruunning containers list
 2)docker ps -a means it shows the running containers list along with stopped containers

9)now,lets know about getting into container (logging in)
  first we have to start the container by giving this command docker start >container name> nd after that we have to attach by giving this command 
docker attach <container name>
now, fynally we get into the container
