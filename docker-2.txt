#TO CREATE A CONTAINER FROM IMAGE

note:
the first thing we have to keep in our mind that we wil have to create a container nd get into it

docker run -it --name <container name> image name /bin/bash

1)i have created a container now nd now i m going create some files, directories nd packages in it

after creation of the container, i have already inside the container
 touch file1
 cat>file1
inserting some data in file1
save the file1 with ctrl+D
giving ll
now existed file1 in this container 
nd seeing info in file1 by cat file1

now, i m installing some packages in it
note: if ubuntu image, we have to give apt instead of yum( if base image ubuntu)

before installing some package, we have to give update for image once

apt update -y

now installing

apt install git -y
.
.
.
.
installed git package in this container

checking now 
ll
existed files, i can see
git --version
i can see installed package version

now i m getting out from this container by giving exit

fynally, a container has bben created along with some files nd packages


out main objective is to create an image from container 

first thing. we have to commit this container nd need to update the image...

docker commit <container name>(previous cont name) update image name(need to give new name to this image)(already we have base image,from that we created a container)

check docker images now
docker images ls
new image has been created in that list by giving with our own name


now i wil create a container with this newly created image(everything wil be replicated into new container from which image os,data etcc)
 docker run -it --name <container name> updated image name /bin/bash

created a container nd inside 

i wil check in this image' softwears,files from where this image came from(container)

ll
i can see files where i created before, it wil replicate here
yeah, i can see file1 that i created in previous cont
git vesion 
yeah, i can see git version


same process for creating files nd softwears nd building them with new image.......
