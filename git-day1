1)Git is not a tool, it is a package.
2)it is a verson control system(vcs) or source code management(scm).
3)it is used to track the changes in files.
4)and wil maintain multiple of versions of same file.
5)platform independent, free and open source.
6)can handle larger projects efficiently.
7)save time and developers can fetch and pull requests without swtiching.


NOTE:

1)git is a 3rd generation tool in version control system.

EXAMPLE FOR FEW FREE TOOLS FOR SCM:
Git, SVN

EXAMPLE FOR FEW PAID TOOLS FOR SCM:
Bit bucket, P4, Stash

                          #Git Stages# (3stages)

*Working Directory
*Staging Area
*Repository

1)Working Directory:
i)In this stsge, git is only aware of having files in the project.
ii)It wont track these files until we committhose files.

2)Staging Area:
i)suppose, we have some files now
ii)we should have to add those file nd they wil come into staging area.
iii)Staging area wil come before commit.

3)Repository:
i)Repository is ntg bt,we can say that it is a directory or folder.
ii)Reposity in git is considered as project folder.
iii)A repository has all project related data.
iv)It contains collection of files nd history of changes made to those files.


types of repos in git:
*Local Repo
*Central Repo
*Remote REPO

i)LOCAL REPO:
      the local repository is everything in .git directory. Mainly what we see in our local repository that all of our commmits
and checkpoints. It is an area that saves everything.

ii)CENTRAL REPO:
      Central repo means where we can store all our source code and make it available for others to chcek it and change it simply
This is what we called GITHUB.

iii)REMOTE REPO:
     Remote repo means the repository which is located in a remote system. we send our code to remote repo to anyone which is 
residing in remote location.

NOTE2:
Diff types of repositories in GIT:
i)LOCAL REPO ii)CENTRAL REPO iii)REMOTE REPO

Diff types of repositories in GITHUB:
i)PUBLIC REPO ii)PRIVATE REPO

NOTE3:
i)MASTER BRANCH is the default branch in GIT.
ii)MAIN BRANCH is the default branch in GITHUB.


After installing the git, we wil have to initiate the git. Then only, .git file wil be existed in hidden files.
we should not remove this file not to get an errors.

Lets see practically now


SOME IMP COMMANDS:
yum install git -y
git init .
git -version

STEPS TO COMMIT A FILE:
  Suppose, now we have a file1

TO ADD A FILE THEN COMMAND:
git add filename

TO COMMIT A FILE WITH A MSG THEN COMMAND:
git commit -m "commitb msg we want" filename

TO SEE THE DETAILS OF THE FILE THEN THE COMMAND:
git log or git log --oneline git log --graph line

TO SEE THE UNTRACKED FILES LIST ND DELETED FILES THEN COMMAND:
git status 

suppose we want to configure of user then the command:
git config user.name "somename" filename
git config user.email "someemail" filename

suppose, we want to restore some deleted file then the command(recently files can be restored):
git restore filename

NOTE4)

i)File wont be commited until we dont add that file. so, we should add that file nd commit.
ii)The untracked files are ntgt but, they are ready to be committed.
